# Guarantee ./venv exists and can import everything server.py needs.
#
# Why this exists (2026-09-07): serve.sh used to fall back to the system
# python3 when venv/bin/python was missing. System python is PEP-668 and can
# never hold nodriver, so a deleted venv became a crash loop reporting
# "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nodriver'" — 241 restarts, nothing
# listening on 8081, and no alarm anywhere. Worse, the venv had been gone for
# ten days: the running process already held its imports, so the service kept
# answering normally until the next restart exposed it.
#
# So a missing venv is treated as a repairable state, not a fatal one, and
# `check` exposes it while it is still latent.
#
#   ./ensure-venv.sh check    exit 0 if the venv imports, 1 if not. Changes nothing.
#   ./ensure-venv.sh          check, and rebuild the venv if the check fails.
#
# Every message goes to stderr: mcp.sh calls this and its stdout is the MCP
# protocol channel, where one stray line corrupts the JSON frames.
